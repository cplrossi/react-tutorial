# React Tutorial
This is a (bit type annotated) standalone version for the React
Framework [Tutorial:
Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

It uses Webpack, TypeScript and Babel. After a build, the file
`index.html` sources the file `dist/bundle.js`; that's all.

## Build
To build this web app, `cd` into the project root and run:
```shell
npm i && npm run build
```

If you want to preview this app, run:
```shell
npm run preview
```
